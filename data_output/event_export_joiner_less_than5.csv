I’m so excited to invite you to a special birthday getaway I’ve been planning! This year, I wanted to do something a little different more relaxing, intentional, and surrounded by nature. I’ve carefully put together a trip in Joshua Tree, and it would mean so much to me if you could be part of it.

I’ll be covering the majority of the costs for both the Airbnb and a private yoga/sound bath session I’ve booked. I’m kindly asking guests if they’re able to pitch in $90 for the Airbnb and $40 for the yoga experience.

The yoga session will include a full class, a soothing sound bath, and a mimosa bar to enjoy afterward. 🧘‍♀️🍾

I'll be creating a group chat as the date gets closer to keep everyone in the loop, and I’ll also be sharing photos of the Airbnb soon!

If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out. I truly hope you can join and help make this birthday extra special!

Megan,Megan + Jayden's Wedding Rehearsal Dinner,,open,2025-05-17,2025-10-04,"Hi!

As you know, Jayden and I are getting married on October 4, 2025. We have been planning the wedding for some time, and ultimately chose to have a smaller, more intimate wedding with mostly family and a few friends from our respective grad schools/hometowns that we’ve known for years. While we are happy with our choice to have a smaller wedding, we didn’t expect to meet so many people in Utah this year that we have grown to love so much (yes, you!) We would be honored to have our new community be a part of our marriage on our wedding day and beyond, and we would love to be able to celebrate with you! Unfortunately, we are unable to invite more people to our actual wedding given the seating capacity that the venue has allotted us. However, we are hosting a rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding and would love to have you join us if you are free! 

Here is where we are having the dinner:

Kaneo
508 Main St, Park City, Utah , 84060

Mediterranean food and cocktails located on the historic Main Street in Park City! There are public parking lots stationed up and down main street. We recommend the Swede Alley lot, located at: 145-147 Swede Alley, Park City, UT 84060. It is right behind the KANEO restaurant.

We hope you can join us! <3
