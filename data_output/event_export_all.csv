I’m so excited to invite you to a special birthday getaway I’ve been planning! This year, I wanted to do something a little different more relaxing, intentional, and surrounded by nature. I’ve carefully put together a trip in Joshua Tree, and it would mean so much to me if you could be part of it.

I’ll be covering the majority of the costs for both the Airbnb and a private yoga/sound bath session I’ve booked. I’m kindly asking guests if they’re able to pitch in $90 for the Airbnb and $40 for the yoga experience.

The yoga session will include a full class, a soothing sound bath, and a mimosa bar to enjoy afterward. 🧘‍♀️🍾

I'll be creating a group chat as the date gets closer to keep everyone in the loop, and I’ll also be sharing photos of the Airbnb soon!

If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out. I truly hope you can join and help make this birthday extra special!

Hosted by the amazing Maureen Lloyd, the night starts at her place with drinks flowing, food grilling, and games happening. When the sun goes down, we’re taking the party seaside and walking over to The Columns Bar to keep the night alive.

It’s a destination for some, we know—but if you can swing it, we’d love nothing more than to have you there to celebrate with us. Come ready for fun, good vibes, and one small rule: everyone wears ALL WHITE.

Megan,2uWgKAbzqtR4j7xa98DbwzKdBSN2,Megan + Jayden's Wedding Rehearsal Dinner,,open,17/05/2025,04/10/2025,"Hi!

As you know, Jayden and I are getting married on October 4, 2025. We have been planning the wedding for some time, and ultimately chose to have a smaller, more intimate wedding with mostly family and a few friends from our respective grad schools/hometowns that we’ve known for years. While we are happy with our choice to have a smaller wedding, we didn’t expect to meet so many people in Utah this year that we have grown to love so much (yes, you!) We would be honored to have our new community be a part of our marriage on our wedding day and beyond, and we would love to be able to celebrate with you! Unfortunately, we are unable to invite more people to our actual wedding given the seating capacity that the venue has allotted us. However, we are hosting a rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding and would love to have you join us if you are free! 

Here is where we are having the dinner:

Kaneo
508 Main St, Park City, Utah , 84060

Mediterranean food and cocktails located on the historic Main Street in Park City! There are public parking lots stationed up and down main street. We recommend the Swede Alley lot, located at: 145-147 Swede Alley, Park City, UT 84060. It is right behind the KANEO restaurant.

We hope you can join us! <3

DELETED_USER,DELETED_USER,Nakya's Birthday 5K & Field Day,,open,18/05/2025,21/06/2025,"This year, I'm celebrating my 32nd birthday by doing what I love: Moving my body outside! I'd love if you'd join me. Whether you're a runner, a walker or just want to play some good old fashioned games, you're invited.

Here's what's going down:
-5K fun run/walk. Go at your own pace! We'll be taking off at 9:50am. 
-Then: Field Day Games. Think: tug og war, potato sack race, snatch the cone, kickball and more

Why? Because I want to create space for joy, movement and connection. If you've wanted to workout with me, need a push to get active, looking to tap into your younger playful self or you just want to hangout, it's all love and it's all welcome. Show up as you are and come celebrate more life! 

Wear your favorite active fit, comfy shoes and bring good energy.",,00c8d1f0-3395-11f0-8737-bff6a133c8f3,,18/05/2025,,100,,100,0
